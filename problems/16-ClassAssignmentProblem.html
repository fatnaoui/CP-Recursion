Problem Name: Class Assignment  <br>
Problem Constraints: 1<=T<=20    <br>
1<=n<=25          <br>
Problem Description:     <br>
In a mathematics class, Teacher ask Alice to find the number of all n digit distinct integers which is formed by the two distinct digits **a<sub>i</sub>** and **b<sub>i</sub>** but there is a rule to form n digit integer.<br><br>

**Rule:** She has to form n digit integer by using two digits a<sub>i</sub> and b<sub>i</sub> without consecutive b<sub>i</sub>.<br><br>

Alice is very weak in maths section. Help her to find the number of such n digit integers.<br><br>


Input Format: The first line contains T, the number of test cases.<br>
Further T lines contains the value n which is the number of digit in the integer.<br>
Sample Input: 3    <br>
1      <br>
2      <br>
3       <br>
Output Format: For each test case print the number of such n digit integer.<br>
Sample Output: #1 : 2         <br>
#2 : 3                     <br>
#3 : 5                            <br>
